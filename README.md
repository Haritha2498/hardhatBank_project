##  CertLedger :ledger: :scroll: ##
CertLedger DApp is an innovative decentralized application that leverages blockchain technology to manage digital certificates with enhanced security and transparency. With CertLedger, users can easily create new certificates by entering their details, such as name, course, and date of issuance. Once created, these certificates are securely recorded on the blockchain, ensuring they are immutable and tamper-proof.

CertLedger also allows users to retrieve their certificates at any time by simply providing the corresponding certificate ID. This feature ensures that certificates are always accessible and verifiable, providing a trustworthy way for individuals and institutions to manage and authenticate important documents. The use of blockchain technology guarantees that all certificates stored on CertLedger are permanent, auditable, and resistant to unauthorized changes.

## üéØ Purpose ##
The purpose of CertLedger DApp is to provide a secure, transparent, and reliable platform for issuing, managing, and verifying digital certificates using blockchain technology. By leveraging the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain, CertLedger ensures that certificates are tamper-proof and easily accessible.
